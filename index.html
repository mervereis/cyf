            Bursa is one of Turkey's most important historical cities and is chock-a-block stuffed with monuments,
            mosques, and other tourist attractions dating from the early years of the Ottoman Empire.

            It's also one of the best places to visit for touring foodies, as it is home base for Turkey's Iskender
            kebap, one of the most famous kebab dishes in the country.

            Sprawling at the foot of the mighty mountain of Uludağ, Bursa also offers plenty of things to do outdoors
            for more active-minded travelers.

            In winter, Uludağ is a major winter sports destination, home to Turkey's most popular ski resort, while the
            Bursa Teleferik cable car operates year-round up the slopes for those who want to add some mountain scenery
            into their city sightseeing itinerary.

            Easily reached from Istanbul by regular ferries across the Marmara Sea and then a short bus ride, Bursa
            makes for a good add-on to an Istanbul visit.

            Bursa is also an excellent stop-off point for Turkey trips heading down to the Aegean or Mediterranean
            coast.
